    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Patch Time Series Transformer (PatchTST)** is a new method for long-term forecasting based on Transformer modeling. In PatchTST, a time series is segmented into subseries-level patches that are served as input tokens to Transformer. PatchTST was first proposed in 2023 in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.14730.pdf). It can achieve state-of-the-art results when compared to other Transformer-based models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Channel Independence PatchTST** is a variant of PatchTST where each channel contains a single univariate time series that shares the same embedding and Transformer weights across all the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to fine tune a Channel Independence PatchTST model in a supervised way. Fine tuning will be set up to only affect the last linear layer of the model -- this is called *linear probing*. The model is trained using patches extracted from a longer segment of the time series as input, with the future values as a target.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the second of three notebooks that should be run in sequence using training and test data from the ETTh1 benchmark dataset, which represents oil temperature in an electric transformer. After running the first notebook, `01_patch_tst_pretrain.ipynb`, a pretrained model was saved in your private storage. This notebook will load the pretrained model and create a fine tuned model, which will be also saved in your private storage. The third notebook, `03_patch_tst_inference.ipynb`, will perform inferencing using the fine tuned model, with a goal of predicting the future temperature of the oil in the electric transformer.\n",

    "# Channel Independence PatchTST\n",
    "\n",
    "**Channel Independence PatchTST** is an efficient design of Transformer-based models for multivariate time series forecasting and self-supervised representation learning. It is demonstrated in the following diagram. It is based on two key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- segmentation of time series into subseries-level patches that are served as input tokens to Transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "- channel independence where each channel contains a single univariate time series that shares the same embedding and Transformer weights across all the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patching design naturally has three-fold benefit: local semantic information is retained in the embedding; computation and memory usage of the attention maps are quadratically reduced given the same look-back window; and the model can attend longer history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Channel independence allows each time series to have its own embedding and attention maps while sharing the same model parameters across different channels.\n",

    "This notebook showed how to fine tune a Channel Independence PatchTST model in a supervised way. Fine tuning was set up to only affect the last linear layer of the model (linear probing). The model was trained using patches extracted from a longer segment of the time series as input, with the future values as a target.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the second of three notebooks that should be run in sequence using training and test data from the ETTh1 benchmark dataset, which represents sensor data from an electric transformer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above output shows the performance (training loss and validation loss) of the model during the fine tuning process. In this case we are using mean squared error (MSE) as a loss function. As the epochs progress we want performance to improve. We would like to see the training and validation losses decrease rapidly for a few epochs and then converge. Validation loss should be relatively close to training loss. Large differences between training and validation losses may be indicative of overfitting (training much lower than validation) or distribution shift between training and validation datasets."

    "[This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.14730.pdf) provides detailed information on Channel Independence PatchTST, including evaluations of its performance on 8 popular datasets, including Weather, Traffic, Electricity, ILI and 4 Electricity Transformer Temperature datasets (ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2). These publicly available datasets have been extensively utilized for benchmarking. We featured one of them (ETTh1) in this notebook.\n",
