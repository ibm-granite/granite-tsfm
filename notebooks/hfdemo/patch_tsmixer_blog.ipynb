    "`PatchTSMixer` is a lightweight time-series modeling approach based on the MLP-Mixer architecture. It is proposed in [TSMixer: Lightweight MLP-Mixer Model for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09364.pdf) by IBM Research authors `Vijay Ekambaram`, `Arindam Jati`, `Nam Nguyen`, `Phanwadee Sinthong` and `Jayant Kalagnanam`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For effective mindshare and to promote opensourcing - IBM Research joins hands with the HuggingFace team to opensource this model in HF.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this [HuggingFace implementation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/patchtsmixer), we provide PatchTSMixer’s capabilities to facilitate lightweight mixing across patches, channels, and hidden features for effective multivariate time series modeling. It also supports various attention mechanisms starting from simple gated attention to more complex self-attention blocks that can be customized accordingly. The model can be pretrained and subsequently used for various downstream tasks such as forecasting, classification, and regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "`PatchTSMixer` outperforms state-of-the-art MLP and Transformer models in forecasting by a considerable margin of 8-60%. It also outperforms the latest strong benchmarks of Patch-Transformer models (by 1-2%) with a significant reduction in memory and runtime (2-3X). For more details, refer to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09364.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog, we will demonstrate examples of getting started with PatchTSMixer. We will first demonstrate the forecasting capability of `PatchTSMixer` on the Electricity data. We will then demonstrate the transfer learning capability of PatchTSMixer by using the model trained on the Electricity to do zero-shot forecasting on the ETTH2 dataset.\n",
