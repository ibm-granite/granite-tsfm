# TSFM: Time Series Foundation Models
Public notebooks, utilities, and serving components for working with Time Series Foundation Models (TSFM).

The core TSFM time series models have been made available on Hugging Face -- details can be found 
[here](https://github.com/ibm-granite/granite-tsfm/wiki). Information on the services component can be found [here](https://github.com/ibm-granite/granite-tsfm/blob/main/services/inference/README.md).

## Python Version
The current Python versions supported are 3.10, 3.11, 3.12.

## Initial Setup
First clone the repository:
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/ibm-granite/granite-tsfm.git" 
cd granite-tsfm
```

## üìï Notebooks Installation
Several notebooks are provided in the `notebooks` folder. They allow you to perform pre-training and finetuning on the models.
To install use `pip`:

```bash
pip install ".[notebooks]"
```

## üíª Demos Installation
The demo presented at NeurIPS 2023 is available in `tsfmhfdemos`. This demo requires you to have pre-trained and finetuned models in place (we plan to release these at a later date). To install the requirements use `pip`:

```bash
pip install ".[demos]"
```

# Notice
The intention of this repository is to make it easier to use and demonstrate Granite TimeSeries components that have been made available in the [Hugging Face transformers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/index). As we continue to develop these capabilities we will update the code here.
